This is another repository containing Zabbix templates and tools for monitoring IT infrastructure including: servers, web-sites, network devices, hypervisors and other things. 
The templates presented here have been successfully tested and used in at least one ~~bloody~~ enterprise. 
##

<p>
The main ideas are following:

- sharing knowledge and experience to improve enterprise monitoring system using Zabbix
- saving and updating unique templates that you can't find when you really need it right now
- saving IT-engineers' time for deploying and maintaining enterprise monitoring system using Zabbix

So, you can easily use the provided templates as a basis and modify them for your own purposes making the monitoring process more convenient and simpler.
Despite the fact that it is assumed that you have been already familiar with the Zabbix monitoring system, each template has a description and installation instructions.
